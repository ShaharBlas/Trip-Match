# Trip-Match
Please enter the colab project in the link attachted.
Before running the code, you need to create an API key for using Gemini. In this link you can generate your own Gemini api key: https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup?hl=he
After generating a key insert it to the second code box as parameter named api_key. Also notice that you should insert it as a String.
Uncomment and run the third code box if you don't have google-generativeai- pip install -q -U google-generativeai.
Then run all the code boxes.
If you want to use the system as a different user you need to run all the code again.
Enjoy planing your next trip!
